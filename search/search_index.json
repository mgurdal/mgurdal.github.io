CYBERLAB CYBERLAB , was established for students to carry out R&D activities in the field of cyber security. As the leader of the team, I have given practical programming lessons to my teammates, organized the team and managed the workflow in different projects that are carried out together. In the early days of CYBELAB, we were only 8 students under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Ecir U\u011fur K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fcksille. But within 2 years, our team has grown rapidly and today more than 30 talented college students are developing themselves under this organization. AEAT AEAT is a student community that aims to build efficient electric cars. Our team consisted of 20+ students in the fields of mechanical engineering, electronics and communications engineering and computer science. During the time I was on the team, we have prepared for the TUBITAK Alternative Energy race on the TOSFED bay race track. I mostly worked with my teammates from the electronics department. I have developed electric car\u2019s system software. I also have designed a telemetry system that, transmits vehicle's information over a wireless network and shows the analytics in real time on a dashboard.","title":"Education"},{"location":"education/#bachelor-of-computer-engineering","text":"@Suleyman Demirel University During my education, despite not being in the curriculum, I learned to develop web sites with Django and built machine learning models using tensorflow.","title":"Bachelor of Computer Engineering"},{"location":"education/#cyberlab","text":"CYBERLAB , was established for students to carry out R&D activities in the field of cyber security.
