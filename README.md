# Technical Skills

I have

- 5+ years of experience with **python** and
- 1+ years of experience with **react** and other related modern front-end development tools.
- I prefer to write Asynchronous code rather than writing synchronous or multi-threaded code.
- I love unit-testing my code and **jest** and **pytest** are my favorite tools. I am also familiar with other testing concepts such as smoke, functional, end-to-end testing and BDD.

I can use many of today's database systems

- **cassandra** and **mongodb** in NoSQL
- **postgresql**, **mysql**, **citus** in SQL.
- I am familiar with ORM systems like **SQLAlchemy**, **django's orm**, **cql-engine**, **motor** and **hibernate** but I like to use these systems without being completely related to them.

I'm also very familiar with DevOps concepts.

- I can design project development and staging steps in CI environments like **jenkins** or **gitlab**.

# Professional Experience

## tarla.io: Software Engineer and Intern (07/2017-Present)

tarla.io provides information services to solve problems of the farmer and the sector.

<p>
My role was to develop a platform for individual and corporate customers using satellite, sensor and weather services. In the process of working, I used various data processing, analysis and visualization tools. Due to the structure of the service, I designed an asynchronous web service that can manage background tasks.<p/>
<p>
In my internship and in the early months of my job, I developed the admin panel of a new project using react and I took care of the interface of existing projects.
