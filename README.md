# Mehmet GÃ¼rdal

I'm a young and curious software developer.
I have specialized in developing highly scalable systems and **python** is my main weapon.
Recently I am developing myself in **remote sensing** and **data analysis** fields. 
I also develop libraries for popular web servers.

# General Knowledge & Interests
- Open Source
- Data Analysis & Statistics 
- Remote Sensing
- Machine Learning 
- Test Driven Development
- Agile Project Management

# Technical Skills
I have

- 5+ years of experience with **python** and
- 1+ years of experience with **react** and other related modern front-end development tools.
- I prefer writing asynchronous codes rather than synchronous or multi-threaded codes.
- I love unit-testing and **jest** and **pytest** are my favorite tools. I am also familiar with other testing concepts such as smoke, functional, end-to-end testing.

I can use many of today's database systems

- **cassandra** and **mongodb** in NoSQL
- **postgresql**, **mysql**, **citus** in SQL.
- I am familiar with ORM systems like **SQLAlchemy**, **django's orm**, **cql-engine**, **motor** and **hibernate** but I like to use these systems without being completely related to them.

I'm also very familiar with DevOps concepts.

- I can design project development and staging steps in CI environments like **jenkins**, **travis-ci** or **gitlab-ci**.

# Professional Experience
## Metglobal: Software Engineer (08/2019-Present)

## tarla.io: Software Engineer and Intern (07/2017-08/2019)

[tarla.io](https://www.tarla.io) provides information services to solve problems of the farmers and the sector.

<p>
My role was to develop a platform for individual and corporate customers using satellites, sensors and weather services. Due to the structure of the service, I have designed an asynchronous web service that can manage thousands of background tasks. I have also developed algorithms to detect natural disasters using satellite imagery.<p/>
<p>
In my internship and in the early months of my job, I developed the admin panel of a new project using react and I maintained the interfaces of the old projects.
